## 2026-09-10 - Synchronous LocalStorage State Initializers
**Learning:** Calling functions that synchronously access `localStorage` and perform `JSON.parse` directly inside `useState(getStoredData())` forces browser storage disk reads and parsing on every single re-render of the component tree, blocking the main thread.
**Action:** Always use lazy state initializers (`useState(getStoredData)`) for state loaded from `localStorage` or heavy initial sync operations.
